# TASK 1    :   React User Dashboard with Goal Tracking

This is a simple React.js project that implements a user dashboard with goal tracking. Users can be added, searched, and sorted, and their goals can be tracked, including marking them as "In Progress" or "Completed". The project includes features for adding users, displaying their goals, and showing a summary of goals and their completion status.

## Features
- **User List**: Display a list of users with their name, email, and the number of goals they have.
- **Search and Sort**: Filter users by name or email, and sort the users by name.
- **Add User**: Include a form to add a new user (name, email).
- **User Details**: Clicking on a user shows their goals, with each goal displaying its title, deadline, and status (In Progress, Completed).
- **Goal Tracking Dashboard**: A summary section showing total goals, completed goals, and percentage completion for all users.
